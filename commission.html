        <p> If you'd like to commison there are a few rules ot go over. to help make it more transparent and help people work with their budget. Feel free to dm me if you have questions or want something not described here, like fanfic title header(s) or other graphic design for example.

All commissions are digital, and for personal use only.


Up to two rounds of editing/changes are included at the sketch stage, after this, there must be payment in full before I continue work on the commission

No refunds after I’ve started work on the final drawing, unless work is delayed beyond the agreed time

Commissions will usually take from 1 day to 2 weeks to finish, depending on complexity of the commission and my other commitments

I don’t currently take writing commissions. </p>
